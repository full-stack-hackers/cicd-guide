## Why Tests?

Testing is important to every real project. And while this is no real-world project, it is good to get in the habit of writing and running tests. Also, this will give us a chance to practice
our continuous integration. Most developers think of automated testing and building when they think of continuous integration. So that is exactly what we are going to do. Feel free to add 
as many tests as you like, but we will keep it simple to move on to the meat of this project.
